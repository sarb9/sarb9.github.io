My name is Seyed Alireza Bakhtiari and I am fourth year bachelor student of computer engineering at [Amirkabir University of Technology](https://aut.ac.ir/en).
Moreover I am enthusiastic about Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning, and more specifically Reinforcement learning.
Currently, I'm working on algorithmic-trading systems using Deep Reinforcement Learning at [Particleb](http://particleb.ai/).
